# TODO

1. Implement protocol "george" that resembles a modification of
Bâ‚–/lessleader where votes reference the most recent vote. I.e. vote for
the longest chain of votes, produce block when you have k votes.

2. Get network Spec from Patrick Loiseau's paper/code. Run simulator on
our three protocols. Count votes/blocks. Apply his Gini efficiency
metric.

3. Implement reward schemes. Repeat step 2.
